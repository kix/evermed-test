## Task list
 - [ ] Plan out the architecture
 - [ ] Implement base architecture
 - [ ] Implement stream package
 - [ ] Figure out what MIME package is for
 - [ ] Implement plain HTTP/HTTPS adapter
 - [ ] Implement Google Drive adapter
 - [ ] Implement OneDrive adapter
 - [ ] Add some functional tests?
 - [ ] Extract a wrapper for returning Symfony's `UploadedFile` instances somehow?
 - [ ] Instantiate `Downloader` with a prefilled array of known adapters
 - [ ] Split the library into separate packages per client (e.g. separate package for Google Drive, separate one for OneDrive)
 - [ ] Support for asynchronous interactions (React-PHP event loop, for example).
 - [ ] Consider moving the `ClientInterface` argument from `AdapterInterface#download`

## Architecture Overview

I would approach the task so that usage is as simple as possible. Preferably, the library should accept just
the URL of the file that needs to be downloaded and decide whether the download can be handled, and which specific
handler should be invoked.

It makes sense to implement the downloader as a registry that accepts specific adapter implementations, each having a
method for checking whether a given URL matches the implementation, and a method that actually handles the download.

Returning the resulting file as an `UploadedFile` instance feels a bit Symfony-specific, as well as requiring 
Symfony-specific contracts. This limits the flexibility a bit, since the end user would be forced into Symfony ecosystem;
what if those dependencies are unwanted?
